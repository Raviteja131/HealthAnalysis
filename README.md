https://ravitejamoningi.shinyapps.io/HealthAnalysis/

The R Shiny dashboard for healthcare analysis provides an interactive platform to visualize and explore patient data. The dashboard consists of three main tabs:

Overview: Displays summary statistics of the dataset and a bar chart of gender distribution.
Patient Stats: Shows histograms for age and blood pressure distributions.
BMI & Cholesterol: Visualizes BMI and cholesterol distributions using histograms.
The dashboard is built using shinydashboard, ggplot2, and dplyr, allowing users to easily interact with the healthcare data and gain insights. The design can be customized to suit various healthcare analysis needs.

shiny: Manages the interaction between user inputs and outputs, allowing dynamic content.
shinydashboard: Provides the layout and structure for organizing dashboard components.
ggplot2: Generates the visualizations (charts, histograms) within the dashboard.
dplyr: Facilitates data manipulation and summarization to prepare data for analysis or visualization.
